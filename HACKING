Hacking CMakeQt
---------------

Use common sense, hack as you wish. If you want your stuff to be merged, send
a patch, in unified format(refer diff -Naur ...), to rohityadav89 AT gmail.com

Follow the format and indentation as in every files :)

Copyright
---------
To comply with the GPL, add your name, email address & the year to the top of
any file that you edit. If you bring in code or files from elsewhere, make sure
its GPL-compatible and to put the authors name, email & copyright year to the
top of those files.

Please note that it is not sufficient to write a pointer to the license (like a
URL). The complete license header needs to be written everytime.

Thanks, now have fun!
