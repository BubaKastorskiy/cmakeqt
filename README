Translations
============

Languages that only needed to be shipped can be selected using LANGS, for example:
  cmake -DLANGS="en;fr" ..

To create ts files, cd to ts folder and do:
  cd ts
  lupdate ../src/* -ts template.ts

Now, send this template to the translators and ask them to rename and send you the file as cmakeqt_<lang-token>.ts;
where, lang token can be fr_FR etc.

If you add a new language translation, simple add the token to the lang list in ts/CMakeLists.txt
For testing I've added a french translation, which is explicitly ran in src/main.cpp

Hack hack hack!

Building
========

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake .. && make
  
The binary will be created in <build-folder>/bin

Packaging
=========

1. On Linux: 
  make package

  To force deb:
    cpack -G DEB

  To force rom:
    cpack -G RPM

2. On Mac: (gcc, g++, make, cmake, qt 4.6+ etc. must be installed...)
  cd contribs
  sh contribs-mac.sh
  This will by default create a Mac Bundle, vlmc.app in /build/bin

  To create a dmg image:
    Uncomment #dmg in /src/CMakeLists.txt, at the end of the file.
    and follow the build process, the dmg will be created in /build/bin

3. To cross-compile and package on linux for windows:

  cd contribs
  sh contribs.sh
  mkdir win32 && cd win32
  cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-win32.cmake ..
  make
  make installer
